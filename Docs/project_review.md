# Project Overview

## 1. Introduction
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based Python project where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess it. After every guess, the program provides a hint — whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the secret number.

This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as input/output handling, loops, conditional statements, random number generation, and error handling.
