The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python console project where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it. After every attempt, the program provides helpful hints such as whether the guess is too high or too low, and once the correct number is guessed, it displays the total number of attempts taken. This project demonstrates basic Python concepts including loops, conditional statements, input handling, random number generation, and error handling using try-except. It was developed using Visual Studio Code and managed with Git and GitHub for version control and documentation. The project contains the main Python file (game.py), a README file, a .gitignore file, and a docs folder that includes three Markdown documents: an overview, the development process, and possible future improvements. To run the game, Python must be installed; the user can clone the repository, optionally create and activate a virtual environment, and execute the game using the command “python game.py.” The user enters guesses in the terminal and receives feedback after each attempt. Although simple, this project is effective for practicing programming fundamentals, understanding project structure, and learning proper documentation practices. In the future, the game can be enhanced by adding difficulty levels, a replay option, a graphical interface using Tkinter, high-score tracking, or a multiplayer mode.
